# Blue Pill Programming

## Using the ST-LINK V2 Debugger/Programmer
Connect the debugger/programmer to the Blue Pill as described below:  
    STM32       -->    ST-LINK V2  
-    VCC 3.3Vpin -->	pin8 3.3V  
-    SWDIO pin  	--> pin2 SWDIO  
-    SWCLK pin   -->	pin6 SWCLK  
-    GND pin     -->	pin4 GND  

## Using the Arduino IDE with your STM32 Blue Pill Microcontroller Board

### Note: I tried this method as described by the tutorial, and several others and was unable to make use of the Blue Pill with its USB port
The following link helped provide instructions on using the Arduino IDE with the Blue Pill [_STM32 Arduino IDE Programming (STM32DUINO) â€“Blue Pill_](https://deepbluembedded.com/stm32-arduino-ide-blue-pill-stm32f103c8t6)
